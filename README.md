# fetch-rewards-challenge
This repo is exclusive for the rewards challenge of fetch. 

Parts 1, 2 and 4 are answered in the pdf. Part 3 is a .ipynb file responisble for data exploration and quality check. 

Please ensure the following:

1. Jupyternote book is downloaded and python3 is used. 
2. JSON files are placed in the same directory where jupyter notebook is created.
3. As a back, I have also added the PDF version of the code and the output that is generated in the jupyter notebook, alongside with the raw .py file.
